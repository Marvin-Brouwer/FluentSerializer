[//]: # (Body)

If you have a specific use-case in which this library may help (or has helped), we would be very grateful if you would illustrate this in our repository as an example.  
We do have some rules for this though:

- The API you're interfacing with or the document format _**HAS**_ to be publicly available.
- Be professional, we don't want to flame or shame.
  It's about how _your_ use-case doesn't fit the data format, not how you don't agree with how the format looks.
- Be verbose and clear
  Link to entity documentation in CSDOCs, reference documentation in the readme and in services/helper etc.  
  Don't forget to provide examples when you create a custom converter, please show how you expect the data to look and why you need that translated.

Apart from those things, you have a lot of freedom.  
Implementation wise we're looking for tests displaying a typical serialization and deserialization example.  
How you implement this is up to you.  

Keep in mind that adding use-cases is also considered contributing, so it will need to pass code review.  
A link to the contribution guide should be placed here once we fleshed that out.
