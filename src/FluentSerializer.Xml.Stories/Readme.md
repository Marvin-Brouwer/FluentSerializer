# FluentSerializer.Xml.Stories

This project contains some simulated real world examples to test the library against.
Meaning that the models used may not be production code but it's validating against the actual output of an existing api.

> **Important:** It's important that these examples are based on public api's that share public documentation so it's both verifiable by documentation
> and we're not exposing things that aren't public by design.
